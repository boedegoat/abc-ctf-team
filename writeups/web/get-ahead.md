# GET aHead

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

first we need to open the given website link: [http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/)

Nothing interesting here, that two buttons are just for changing the website background color. Let's use burpsuite to intercept the http request.

Here's the request when I click Choose Red button

And here's the request when I click Choose Blue button

As you can see, Choose Red button makes a GET request, and Choose Blue button makes a POST request.&#x20;

From the first hint, it says "Maybe you have more than 2 choices". So I look up for another HTTP methods other than GET and POST.

If you look at there, there is a HTTP method called HEAD, and if you haven't notice, this CTF challenge title is "GET aHEAD". So let's try to send HTTP request by using HEAD method.

And that's it, we got the flag `picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_775f2530}`
