# Glory of the Garden-wu

This [garden](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/d0e1ffb10fc0017c6a82c57900f3ffe3/garden.jpg) contains more than it seems.\
\
lets start by looking into the hint 1, which says "What is a hex editor?"

in this challenge i will be using a hex editor called hexyl\
lets start by inputting the command

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

when i press enter it will show the flag in the end of the hex editor

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

and voila we got the flag

flag: picoCTF{more\_than\_m33ts\_the\_3y3eBdBd2cc}
